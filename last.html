          <h1>Do I need to give up my blue jeans?</h1>
          <span class="square"></span>
          <p>
            Do you know how many pairs of jeans are in your closet? Do you have
            any idea where they were made? And how many kilometres they traveled
            before landing in your closet? Although a handful of brands are now
            favoring responsible materials, local production, and dyes and
            washes that consume less water and are less harmful to the planet,
            jeans are still one of the most polluting products in the world.

           Researchers from the University of Georgia (UGA) developed a new 
            indigo dyeing technology that's kinder to our planet. According to the researchers,
            the technique reduces water usage and eliminates the toxic chemicals that make the dyeing process so environmentally damaging. 
            The technology also streamlines the process and secures more colour than traditional methods.
            The new method of dyeing uses natural indigo (though the streamlined process could also use synthetic)
            and eliminates the harmful chemicals used in conventional methods. It also requires 
            only one coat of the indigo to secure over 90 per cent of the colour, significantly reducing
            the amount of water needed to dye the fabric. Conventional methods require up to eight 
            dips in the dye solution and secure only 70-80 per cent.

                <h1>Make Your Jeans Last Longer</h1>
                <span class="square"></span>
                <p><!--Remember, jeans were created to endure the toughest working conditions down in the mines! 
                  That means yours should last you many years (even decades, depending on the quality). 
                  Plus, they’ve been in style for over 100 years, so we all know they’ll always stay trendy.
                  That said, keeping your jeans in good condition can reduce the need to buy new ones yearly.-->
                  Here are a few tips and tricks to get more life out of your denim:<br>
                  Don’t toss your jeans into the washing machine unless they’re truly dirty<br>
                  Follow the wash instructions that come sewn into the jeans.<br>
                  Keep them smelling fresh by spraying a mix of baking soda, essential oils and water.<br>
                  Wash them in a cold cycle, and hang them to dry inside-out.

          <h1>How can you find eco-conscious denim?</h1>
          <span class="square"></span>
          <p>
            Yes! Organic cotton jeans make a big difference. 
            It is believed that organic cotton uses 46% less CO2 in comparison 
            to conventional cotton. It also uses 88% less water. 
            Many denim manufacturing groups are also moving away from
             using toxic synthetic indigo. Companies have now created ways 
             to source and use bio-based indigo instead of synthetic. 
             Another option is of course thrifting!
              It’s a great way to reduce our consumption and support
               keeping denim out of our landfills.
              While updating your fall wardrobe this year, make sure to look out for 
              conscious denim to expand your eco-friendly wardrobe.

                <span class="square"></span>
                <p>Contemporary denim fabrics are sustainable, although the same 
                    cannot be said about the traditional ones. Also, how sustainable
                    denim is dependent on the manufacturer, with some producing them 
                    sustainably, while others using traditional processes. For the traditional
                    variety, a single pair of jeans required an embarrassing amount of chemicals,
                    thousands of liters of water and energy consumption that has been almost 
                    comically outsized compared to the finished product.

          <h1>Where To Buy Sustainable Jeans</h1>
          <span class="square"></span>
          <p>
            When it’s time to buy your next pair of trusty blue jeans, 
            do some research! Now that you know the environmental impact of denim,
             you can shop responsibly and support companies that are transparent 
             with their process. Many companies have begun prioritizing methods that 
             cut back on water waste, recycle and reuse denim, and more.
            Another great way to shop for jeans responsibly is to buy them used. 
            Thrift and consignment stores stock their inventories with trusted brands and quality items, 
            so you know you’ll be getting lots of life out of your purchase. If you’re on the market for a 
            new pair of blue jeans, head over to your local Turn Style — the earth will be glad you did.

                <h1>Recycle Your Denim</h1>
                <span class="square"></span>
                <p>Jeans should last a long time, but when you grow out of them, 
or when they become damaged beyond repair, you can still find 
a use for the material! If your jeans or jacket no longer fit, 
you can always donate or consign, them so someone else can enjoy 
them for years to come! This helps keep jeans out of the landfill 
and contributes to less waste because someone else can wear them 
without purchasing new. The longer a single pair of jeans can be worn,
 the less new waste is created on brand new denim.

For jeans that are beyond repair, there are hundreds of DIY ideas for repurposing old jeans that include:

Headbands
Patchwork blankets & throw rugs
Dish rags
Pouches or purses
In recent years, denim fabric has been recycled into
sustainable building insulation. Find a local recycling center that takes jeans
