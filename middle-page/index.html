        <h1>The denim blues</h1>
        <p>
          From the catwalk to the countryside, ranging in price from $10 to over
          $500, from pants to skirts to jackets, denim is as versatile as it is
          hardy and trendy. Traditionally made from cotton, non-stretchable, and
          designed to be heavy duty owing to its workwear heritage, jeans have a
          rugged history. But with over 2 billion pairs produced worldwide each
          year, just how ethical and sustainable is our beloved blue fabric in
          the modern day? We’ve traced its journey from the field to your
          favourite pair of high-waisted shorts to find out, and curated a list
          of brands doing it better.

        <h2>How denim is made</h2>
        <p>
          Conventionally, denim is made from twill weave cotton fabric. Cotton
          fibres are harvested and spun into yarn, then the yarns are dyed.
          Jeans are often indigo-dyed, making them the classic blue colour for
          denim. Cotton denim is then woven either on a shuttle loom or a
          projectile loom, creating a sturdier or more delicate result
          respectively. While the original jean was made from 100% cotton, these
          days “stretch denim” is increasingly popular. Stretch denim
          incorporates a percentage of elastane and stretch polyesters like
          spandex, more suitable for the flexibility desired in skinny jeans,
          for example. While this addition may be comfier for certain styles,
          changing the fibre composition in such a way impacts the
          sustainability and recyclability of the final product.

        <h3>A move towards better materials</h3>
        <p>
          Some more responsible brands are opting for comfort being imparted
          through the use of soft fibres such as TENCEL™ Lyocell and TENCEL™
          Modal (man-made cellulosic fibres). There is also a move towards more
          sustainable materials in the industry in general—BCI cotton, organic
          cotton, recycled cotton, recycled polyester, man-made cellulosic
          fibres, recycled elastane, and hemp are good examples. However, it’s
          worth noting the move towards organic cotton is not straightforward as
          there is not yet enough organic cotton available globally to meet
          demand.

        <h4>The impact of a pair of jeans on the environment</h4>
        <p>
          The manufacture of denim clothes relies on cotton that is grown using
          exploitative tactics, requires a lot of water to grow, and has to be
          sprayed with heavily toxic pesticides. These pesticides are harmful to
          human health and are an environmental risk. It is also possible to use
          “spun dyed” cellulosic or synthetic yarns (where colour is added
          before the fibre is spun, thereby eliminating the need for garment
          dyeing). Lenzing, the company behind TENCEL™ Lyocell and Modal fibres,
          offers examples of this. <br />
